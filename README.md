## FAQ

#### Is it safe to login to your app as currently the url at http://159.223.91.154/ says that it is not secure?

Yes definitely! All authentication is handled by Google's Firebase & we do not store any information!

#### When will the url be replaced with letters ( with a proper domain name )?

Currently we are planning to change the URL to a domain name called "mystudyspace" where the domain name will reflect our actual product name around July!

#### Why I can't login with Facebook?

Facebook has informed all developers that they require all websites to have SSL/ Https. Currently we are only using http as SSL is not configured

#### When are we launching?

We are planning on a soft launch on Q4 of 2022 for students in NUS and will gradually market towards other students from different schools!
